# Tangible Computing (C/C++)

## Summary
This repository contains selected projects from a systems programming course,
focused on implementing data structures and algorithms in C/C++ w memory allocation

## What I Implemented
- Core data structures (e.g., linked lists, stacks, trees)
- Algorithmic logic with time/space tradeoffs
- Manual memory management and pointer-based data handling
- Debugging and testing of low-level code

## Tools & Languages
C, C++, Make, Shell
